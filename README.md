# machinelearning-tensorflow
Some exploratory machine learning code using Tensorflow written in Python:

- [How to predict variances](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stoerr/machinelearning-tensorflow/blob/master/published/PredictVariability.ipynb)
- A deliberately as simple as possible [LSTM example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stoerr/machinelearning-tensorflow/blob/master/published/LstmTest.ipynb) 
- An attempt to [use the pearson correlation coefficient as custom loss function](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stoerr/machinelearning-tensorflow/blob/master/published/CorrelationLossTest.ipynb)

and some more in directory [published](published/) .
